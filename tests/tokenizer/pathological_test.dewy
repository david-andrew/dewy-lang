# just all the currently broken syntax I can think of

# plain old juxtapose
a(b)

# ambiguous cases
# a(b)(c)
# a(b)^c
# (a,b,c,)

# commas with voids
(,a,b,c)
(a,,b,c)
(,a,,b,+4,,c,)


# based array
0x[1234 + ffabc]

# istring
'hello {world}'

# parametric escape
'\u{1234 + ffabc}'

# keyword expressions
from apple import banana
import peach from pear

# flow
a = if name =? 'hello' 'world' else 'default'

# return
return 1 + 2


# TODO: make a lint/warning if there are ever two tokens juxtaposed that do not have a juxtapose op
#       filter out valid cases like ops next to each other. but here `...` next to `loop` keyword doesn't juxtapose
#       warning hint should note that to juxtapose a keyword expression, wrap the expression in parens
return ...loop x x
