% various syntax for creating strings
'hello world'

% multiline strings
'hello
world'

% simple string escapes
'hello \n world'

% escapes that just insert the character itself
'hello \' world'  % insert a single quote character `'`

% <escape><newline> ignores that newline
'\
Hello, World!

This is a 
multiline string 
without a newline 
at the very start
'


% simple unicode escapes
'\u270c' % ✌️ emoji

% arbitrary unicode escapes
'\u{1F419}' % 🐙 emoji

christmas_tree = 0x1F384
'unicode scalar {christmas_tree} is \u{christmas_tree}'  % unicode scalar 0x1F384 is 🎄
% TODO: this implies that we keep metadata for the format int/etc literals were specified as, for default formatting when printing

% raw strings
r'hello world \ random { symbols }'

r'hello
world'

% strings can use double quote
"hello world"

% strings can use odd-lengthed quotes as delimiters
"""hello world"""
"""""hello world"""""

% string interpolation
name = 'world'
'hello {name}'



% heredoc strings
#"%%% SOME CUSTOM DELIMITER %%%"
This is a heredoc string with a custom delimiter.
It will be parsed as a string until the delimiter is reached.
It includes regular string functionality like {interpolation}, \{} \character escaping, etc.
The delimiter is not included in the string.
#%%% SOME CUSTOM DELIMITER %%%

% raw heredoc strings
#r"==== RAW HEREDOC DELIMITER ===="
This is a raw heredoc string with a custom delimiter.
It will be parsed as a string until the delimiter is reached.
It does not include {interpolation}, \{} \character escaping, etc.
==== RAW HEREDOC DELIMITER ====


% technically byte-strings are also a thing, but they evaluate to an array, not a string
bytes = 0x'00ffab1235ffdc0012'

% Rest-of-file strings
printf#"""Hello, World!

This string continues until the end of the file

No closing delimiter is needed, nor would it match if present

#""" doesn't close the string

This is useful as a data format that can interpolate values defined above

Think myfile.csv.dewy or somedata.json.dewy or mydoc.md.dewy files

You can also make raw rest-of-file strings by using #r"""
but it cannot be shown here because only one rest-of-file string is allowed per file
