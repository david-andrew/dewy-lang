10.25p3  # all base 10. suggested to either warn or error (leaning warn b/c simpler to parse, just look for src[i] in 'eEpP')

0x1.0x8p10   % special case <hex>.<hex>p<dec> gets no warning, even though base mismatch
0x1.0x8p0xA  % no warning, though programmer being extra explicit
0x1.0b1p10   % warn, mantissa halves have different bases
0x1.8p10     % warn, different bases
