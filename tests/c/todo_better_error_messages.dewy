# should ask if you forgot to close the type block
# but instead says it didn't match any tokens (because ] is not valid in the TypeBody context)
# need something that can look at invalid tokens for given context and see if they match the next token
# also should look at if the next token matches a higher context (e.g. the current context is unclosed)
#    ---> might actually lead to better error messages without fishing for possible invalid tokens
#    ---> can then say if the next context is a match, then did you forget to close this context
