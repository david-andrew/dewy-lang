# Phase 1 implementation checkpoints

Started 2026-09-20 from `be7d1b1a`. The scope is all of Phase 1 in
[ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md), with the correctness/parity closure checkpoint
first. This ledger records implementation and validation, not new language
decisions. Open design questions stay open until resolved with David.

## Work remaining

- Correctness/parity: `nat_types` now passes through sound finite-loop
  reasoning. Continue explicit fixture manifests and fresh paired native
  checkpoints at integration boundaries.
- 1.1: complete copy reporting and explicit-copy policy across entry points;
  explicit aggregate copies and local places/views; last-use moves in both
  implementations; deterministic lifecycle hooks and move-only resources;
  measured scoped placement and copy budgets. Keep COW as a provisional
  fallback rather than changing value semantics.
- 1.2: bounded relational proof machinery, mutation/alias-aware facts,
  loop invariants, checked proof boundaries and auditable unsafe boundaries.
  Unsettled surface forms require design review; unsupported proofs must
  remain unknown rather than silently accepted.
- 1.3: effect vocabulary and propagation, effect polymorphism and contracts;
  errors remain return alternatives, separate from effects.
- 1.4: implement and test the settled juxtaposition, reserved-name,
  unit-nominal, and uniform-container decisions. Preserve the decisions to
  keep type brackets and conventional export privacy. Keep the explicitly
  open byte-packing and Unicode escape questions visible.

## Strict-copy cleanup

The inherited uncommitted CLI-only `$explicit_copies` implementation was
removed on 2026-09-20, with its patch and tests archived under
`../dewy-build-artifacts/phase1-2026-09-20`. It depended on incomplete copy
notes, bypassed non-CLI compilation, and prescribed remedies that did not
yet exist. This abandons that partial implementation, not the approved
directive. Reintroduce the policy with the relevant semantic/lowering API,
explicit remedies, source provenance, and acceptance-parity tests. Existing
`dewy analyze` copy reports remain available.

## Validation discipline

Checkpoint: uniform set insertion is implemented in both checkers as
`set.push(value)`, with the old `add` spelling retained as an alias. Both
spellings use the same insertion and mutation rules. Hosted tests cover
execution and rejection of const mutation; the native compiler executes
the shared fixture with its expected result 42.

Checkpoint: both bounds analyzers compose transfers for small, statically
finite loops before falling back to widening. A shared exploration budget
bounds nested work; every reachable body entry participates in validation,
and break/continue exits are retained. This closes `nat_types` without
changing its expected result. It also carries exact array growth through
small fixed loops; general symbolic loop induction remains outstanding.
Comparison narrowing now retains observed field bounds when excluding a
value, so a nonnegative field unequal to zero is positive in either operand
order. Targeted checks passed, and a second-generation native compiler passed
all 11 cases in `tests/fixtures/phase1_parity_cases.json` against the hosted
compiler. The broader corpus passed 210/211 cases and exposed a native `$prototype`
builtin-identity mismatch: registered builtin arithmetic was mistaken for a
user-defined function. The corrected native compiler runs `prototype_panic`
with the expected panic status 102 and still rejects the shadowed-intrinsic
regression. Both cases are now in the focused manifest. A fresh full paired
run remains required at the next integration checkpoint.

Each implementation batch needs acceptance/rejection and independent
execution outcomes, with hosted/native agreement. Ownership batches also
need second-generation native execution. Run complete build/fixed-point
checks at integration checkpoints, not for every small edit. Maintain
separate timing rows for C-built and direct-built executing compilers;
30 seconds is the minimum native target and 10 seconds the stretch goal.

Checkpoint: explicit `.copy()` for arrays, records, dictionaries, and sets
is represented in HIR and both lowerers, with receiver evaluation once and
independent mutation. Existing record members named `copy` take precedence.
Copied numeric, length, and membership facts belong to the destination; an
inferred record initializer now seeds its field facts in both analyzers.
Copy notes carry an explicit-intent flag for the later enforcement policy.
The operation participates in hosted representation discovery and definite
initialization; owned and discarded temporaries are released, including
array results returned through another copy. The lifetime kernel reports
zero retained bytes over 100 repeated calls in both compilers. The native
second-generation compiler built in 48.63 seconds; the C-built seed's first
generation took 21.71 seconds. This remains above the direct-route target.
Hosted copy/report gates passed 11 tests. All 14 focused parity cases
passed against the second-generation native compiler, including independent
expected panic diagnostics; the full corpus run is in progress.

Design review: `PHASE1_DESIGN_PROPOSALS.md` contains proposed proof and effect
surfaces. David requested approval before implementation. These proposals
are not language rules and do not mark 1.2 or 1.3 complete.
