# Phase 0 performance campaign

The acceptance target remains a complete compiler executable build in under
60 seconds through **each** implementation. The module measurements below
are bounded development gates; they do not establish that full-build target.
See [ROADMAP.md](../ROADMAP.md#dedicated-performance-campaign).

## Reproduction and isolation

`tools/measure_compiler.py SOURCE --output NEW_DIRECTORY` measures the hosted
CLI, including its in-process µDewy backend. Add `--native-executable PATH`
and `--udewy-executable PATH` to measure the native pair. Each run uses a fresh
process and empty artifact directory. OS page caches are uncontrolled.
`--profile` adds hosted cProfile data; its elapsed times include profiling
overhead and must not be compared to unprofiled acceptance measurements.
JSON records retain source/revision identity, options, wall time, maximum
process RSS, generated-source sizes/hashes, and hosted phase timings. Maximum
process RSS is not the sum of simultaneously resident child processes.

`tools/check_compiler_parity.py --native-executable PATH --udewy-executable PATH
--output NEW_DIRECTORY` checks each existing end-to-end fixture independently.
Compilation and execution results are separate; expected exits and output are
checked before comparing implementations. `--cases FILE` also accepts negative
cases, and `--hosted-root PATH` pins a source snapshot while development
continues. A timeout, crash, or backend failure does not count as a successful
language rejection. Exact diagnostic wording is not part of parity.

## Initial bounded baseline — 2026-09-14

Machine: Intel Core i7-6700, 3.40 GHz, Linux x86-64. Python 3.14.7, GCC
16.2.1, GNU assembler/linker 2.46.1. Source revision `18fadc66`, module
`dewy/bootstrap/parser/t0.dewy` (SHA-256
`b884a751e3e46eb4779d0f774651237eee985eacdf7630c08bc6532473a88847`).
Native compiler: the verified eighteenth pair, Dewy executable SHA-256
`5140aa2f2bfb5b2a09656d33c59db8f631c49d14e8b1c90ca7adaa99a3243ae8`.
Both invocations produce a direct x86-64 executable; the native compiler
itself was built through C. Default CLI options: hosted emission includes
location markers, native ordinary compilation does not.

| Implementation | Complete invocation | Checking | Lowering | Emission | Backend | Maximum process RSS | µDewy bytes |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Hosted baseline | 34.74 s | 15.51 s | 11.01 s | 2.59 s | 4.71 s | 274,828 KiB | 5,675,282 |
| Native baseline | 61.70 s | — | — | — | — | 941,620 KiB | 5,984,229 |
| Hosted representation query cache | 25.21 s | 15.11 s | 3.67 s | 0.87 s | 4.60 s | 275,424 KiB | 5,675,291 |
| Hosted traversal batch | 23.56 s | 13.40 s | 3.47 s | 0.86 s | 5.01 s | 273,076 KiB | 5,675,288 |

These are single samples, with other work on separate CPUs; use repeated
samples for close comparisons. The nine-byte output difference is entirely
the embedded benchmark directory names in three `$include_bytes` paths.
After normalizing those directory names, emitted text is identical.

The first batch caches representation queries by input identity during
lowering/emission, object layouts and union tags per lowerer, and resolved
source paths per emission. Checked type objects remain strongly referenced
until the scope ends. No query cache spans checker mutations, alias resolution,
brand registration, or compilations. Regression checks cover failed-scope
cleanup, mutable unions, identical uncached output, expected execution, and
array-sharing budgets on direct and C output routes.

The traversal batch caches class field metadata, preserves unchanged subtrees
during module renaming, and walks the prelude dependency graph once per
reachable declaration. Both compilers skip predicate-read traversal when the
invalidated-binding set is empty. Output again matches the original after
directory normalization. Prelude cache restoration, effect summaries, and
native short-circuit proof-path checks pass (22 focused tests).

The next hosted profile shifts attention to cold prelude checking, repeated
analysis traversals, and the µDewy tokenizer. Native phase profiling and
checked-prelude caching remain separate work. The initial full native
self-build baseline remains the approximately 25-minute generation recorded
in [PERFORMANCE.md](PERFORMANCE.md#completed-native-fixed-point-2026-09-14).

## Shared native record operations

The verified native compiler emitted 96.7 MB for its own source: 19.7 MB was
record copy helpers and 7.3 MB release helpers. Parent views repeatedly
expanded every descendant's concrete fields, including inline nested records
and union cells. Native lowering now shares family dispatch separately from
exact field operations. Arena-free copies stay in their caller's frame.

The twelve-level `native_record_family_helpers.dewy` kernel drops from
281,377 to 124,977 bytes of µDewy (56% smaller), with checking/lowering/emission
through the dedicated direct lowering driver falling from 6.27 to 4.38 seconds.
Both versions execute correctly through direct and C backends. Its committed
160 KB output budget catches reintroducing the expansion. Another new kernel
checks descendant copies through nested records, arrays and optional cells;
128 repeated scopes retain zero arena bytes. Thirty-nine existing record,
brand and reclamation cases also pass on both output routes. These are kernel
results, not yet a measurement of the full compiler's new generated size.
