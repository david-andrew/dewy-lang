# Phase 0 performance campaign

The acceptance target remains a complete compiler executable build in under
60 seconds through **each** implementation. The module measurements below
are bounded development gates; they do not establish that full-build target.
See [ROADMAP.md](../ROADMAP.md#dedicated-performance-campaign).

## Reproduction and isolation

`tools/measure_compiler.py SOURCE --output NEW_DIRECTORY` measures the hosted
CLI, including its in-process µDewy backend. Add `--native-executable PATH`
and `--udewy-executable PATH` to measure the native pair. Each run uses a fresh
process and empty artifact directory. OS page caches are uncontrolled.
`--profile` adds hosted cProfile data; its elapsed times include profiling
overhead and must not be compared to unprofiled acceptance measurements.
JSON records retain source/revision identity, options, wall time, maximum
process RSS, generated-source sizes/hashes, and hosted phase timings. Maximum
process RSS is not the sum of simultaneously resident child processes.

`tools/check_compiler_parity.py --native-executable PATH --udewy-executable PATH
--output NEW_DIRECTORY` checks each existing end-to-end fixture independently.
Compilation and execution results are separate; expected exits and output are
checked before comparing implementations. `--cases FILE` also accepts negative
cases, and `--hosted-root PATH` pins a source snapshot while development
continues. A timeout, crash, or backend failure does not count as a successful
language rejection. Exact diagnostic wording is not part of parity.
The default inventory includes ten isolated rejection fixtures for names,
initialization, types, bounds, const mutation and stored contracts. Both
baseline compilers reject all ten at the language-checking boundary.

## Initial bounded baseline — 2026-09-14

Machine: Intel Core i7-6700, 3.40 GHz, Linux x86-64. Python 3.14.7, GCC
16.2.1, GNU assembler/linker 2.46.1. Source revision `18fadc66`, module
`dewy/bootstrap/parser/t0.dewy` (SHA-256
`b884a751e3e46eb4779d0f774651237eee985eacdf7630c08bc6532473a88847`).
Native compiler: the verified eighteenth pair, Dewy executable SHA-256
`5140aa2f2bfb5b2a09656d33c59db8f631c49d14e8b1c90ca7adaa99a3243ae8`.
Both invocations produce a direct x86-64 executable; the native compiler
itself was built through C. Default CLI options: hosted emission includes
location markers, native ordinary compilation does not.

| Implementation | Complete invocation | Checking | Lowering | Emission | Backend | Maximum process RSS | µDewy bytes |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Hosted baseline | 34.74 s | 15.51 s | 11.01 s | 2.59 s | 4.71 s | 274,828 KiB | 5,675,282 |
| Native baseline | 61.70 s | — | — | — | — | 941,620 KiB | 5,984,229 |
| Hosted representation query cache | 25.21 s | 15.11 s | 3.67 s | 0.87 s | 4.60 s | 275,424 KiB | 5,675,291 |
| Hosted traversal batch | 23.56 s | 13.40 s | 3.47 s | 0.86 s | 5.01 s | 273,076 KiB | 5,675,288 |
| Hosted lexer batch | 21.20 s | 10.53 s | 4.16 s | 0.92 s | 4.67 s | 273,148 KiB | 5,675,273 |

These are single samples, with other work on separate CPUs; use repeated
samples for close comparisons. The nine-byte output difference is entirely
the embedded benchmark directory names in three `$include_bytes` paths.
After normalizing those directory names, emitted text is identical.

The first batch caches representation queries by input identity during
lowering/emission, object layouts and union tags per lowerer, and resolved
source paths per emission. Checked type objects remain strongly referenced
until the scope ends. No query cache spans checker mutations, alias resolution,
brand registration, or compilations. Regression checks cover failed-scope
cleanup, mutable unions, identical uncached output, expected execution, and
array-sharing budgets on direct and C output routes.

The traversal batch caches class field metadata, preserves unchanged subtrees
during module renaming, and walks the prelude dependency graph once per
reachable declaration. Both compilers skip predicate-read traversal when the
invalidated-binding set is empty. Output again matches the original after
directory normalization. Prelude cache restoration, effect summaries, and
native short-circuit proof-path checks pass (22 focused tests).

The next hosted profile shifts attention to cold prelude checking, repeated
analysis traversals, and the µDewy tokenizer. Native phase profiling and
checked-prelude caching remain separate work. The initial full native
self-build baseline remains the approximately 25-minute generation recorded
in [PERFORMANCE.md](PERFORMANCE.md#completed-native-fixed-point-2026-09-14).

## Shared native record operations

The verified native compiler emitted 96.7 MB for its own source: 19.7 MB was
record copy helpers and 7.3 MB release helpers. Parent views repeatedly
expanded every descendant's concrete fields, including inline nested records
and union cells. Native lowering now shares family dispatch separately from
exact field operations. Arena-free copies stay in their caller's frame.

The twelve-level `native_record_family_helpers.dewy` kernel drops from
281,377 to 124,977 bytes of µDewy (56% smaller), with checking/lowering/emission
through the dedicated direct lowering driver falling from 6.27 to 4.38 seconds.
Both versions execute correctly through direct and C backends. Its committed
160 KB output budget catches reintroducing the expansion. Another new kernel
checks descendant copies through nested records, arrays and optional cells;
128 repeated scopes retain zero arena bytes. Thirty-nine existing record,
brand and reclamation cases also pass on both output routes. These are kernel
results, not yet a measurement of the full compiler's new generated size.

## Lexer copying and next integration seed

Sampling the full hosted build exposed a source suffix copy for every token
class probe. Sharing that suffix across probes, selecting longest matches in
one pass, and using offsets for inner delimiter tests reduces tokenization of
`bootstrap/backend/udewy/lower.dewy` from 44.83 to 3.83 seconds. Both versions
produce exactly the same 70,656 token kinds, texts, spans and indices (combined
SHA-256 `ce923f4d2e8bd993c82d280c10a68695ebe21c8ef8a728cc5dc2834e28fdaedf`).
The µDewy tokenizer also groups ordinary symbol probes by initial character,
retaining longest-match order and contextual token handling. Forty-nine lexer,
literal-boundary and µDewy precedence/type tests pass. These changes preserve
µDewy's conditional-only short-circuit rule.

A full hosted C build of revision `8116d279` successfully produced the next
native test compiler: 113.7 MB of µDewy and 215.3 MB of C. Its initial sampling
profiler substantially perturbed checking and interrupted the measurement
parent; the compiler child completed successfully. This is an integration
artifact, **not a clean full-build timing**. Recorded phase times include
198.5 seconds checking, 103.2 lowering, 17.4 emission, and 428.6 backend; maximum
process RSS was 6,735,356 KiB. The build bypassed ccache and used GCC with
eight LTO jobs.

That hosted-built seed compiles the t0 module in 71.71 seconds, producing
4,583,067 bytes of µDewy (23% less than the verified native baseline), with
maximum process RSS of 3,571,432 KiB. The seed's storage behavior differs from
the native-built baseline, so this does not establish a runtime improvement
for the helper batch: generation provenance must accompany native timings.
It has not yet passed a new native fixed-point verification. The sub-minute
full-build target remains open.

## Hosted record-family helpers

The hosted backend now also selects shared concrete-field helpers for arena
copies and releases. Non-moving result writes reuse ordinary arena copies
when their fields need no caller-prepared fixed-array storage; move/adopt and
prepared-array cases retain their separate rules. The guarded twelve-level
inheritance fixture shrinks from 2,544,010 to 607,930 bytes (76% smaller), with
both outputs returning the expected result through direct and C backends.
The new hosted output budget is 700 KB, including reachable runtime code.
Another execution case covers fixed arrays nested in both base and descendant
fields, so sharing cannot silently discard prepared destination storage.
Sixty-six focused ownership, array-sharing, release and default-argument tests
pass alongside those two new cases.

The inheritance fixture now also guards its variable-length indexed reads
and writes, allowing the complete hosted checker to validate it. Its native
lowering-driver output is 146,253 bytes, still below the existing 160 KB gate,
and executes correctly on both routes. The earlier 124,977-byte native kernel
measurement predates those guards; compare like fixture revisions.

## Isolated parity repair: lenient set pop

The accepted-program inventory exposed a native crash in `sets.dewy`.
`pop(key default=none)` returned bare payloads on both branches instead of
the optional cell its checked result type requires; discarding a missing
result then dereferenced zero during cleanup. Native lowering now packs
both alternatives and releases an unused packed default with its result
type. The isolated fixture crashes through both old output backends and
returns 42 through both updated backends. The hosted version also returns
42. Cases cover present/absent/discarded integer and string results, eager
defaults, and zero retained arena growth over 64 repeated scopes. A fresh
full-native corpus run remains an integration gate.

## Full-build checkpoint and array copy expansion

The complete `e305d2e6` source snapshot (including the imported
`tools/dewy_test.dewy`) builds through hosted Python and GCC in 667.44 seconds:
83.59 checking, 107.57 lowering, 18.87 emission, and 451.94 in the backend.
Maximum process RSS is 6,948,352 KiB. A short nonblocking 5 Hz sample spans
late lowering, emission and µDewy tokenization; other kernel tests overlap
the C build. Treat this as an integration measurement, not a controlled
acceptance run. Its native test seed builds t0 in 69.40 seconds and emits
4,275,940 bytes, with maximum process RSS 3,554,960 KiB. It is not a newly
verified native fixed point.

The 118.9 MB full hosted output includes 12.1 MB of source-location comments
and 12.7 MB of variable comments. The longer snapshot paths explain much of
the increase from the earlier build; record helpers account for only a small
part of the remaining 94 MB of code. Most code sits in ordinary functions.

Hosted lowering now shares complete non-moving dynamic-array copies,
including their wide-union fallback loops. Both paths already return
arena-owned descriptors. Frame-rooted records can also share their field
operations when every nested allocation already has arena lifetime; fixed
arrays and moves retain their distinct rules. The t0 module emits 5,466,153
bytes in 21.06 seconds (a bounded sample), so this alone is not the large
full-build improvement still needed. A 24-caller, twelve-alternative union
array kernel drops from 946,621 to 729,334 bytes, under an 850 KB gate.

That kernel also exposed an older hosted leak when overwriting optional or
union array elements. The replacement now releases the old cell and its
active payload after detachment, while respecting pinned containers. The
native implementation already reclaimed these cells. Both implementations
now return the expected result with zero growth across repeated kernel
scopes on direct and C backends; additional cases cover self-replacement and
pinned old-cell pointers. Sixty-nine existing ownership, sharing, string,
array and object tests pass with array helper sharing enabled.

## Static literals and shared value dispatch

The hosted ordinary CLI now omits source/variable debug metadata. `dewy debug`
retains both, in its existing separate cache artifact; the codegen API keeps
its explicit/default debug controls. Literal bytes, packed grapheme offsets,
and descriptors are emitted as relocatable static data. Descriptors remain
separate per lowering site. This removes repeated initialization stores;
it does not add a source-level interning rule. Repeated large ASCII, combined
Unicode graphemes, and empty literals pass direct and C execution checks.

The same t0 module drops from 5,466,153 bytes to 4,299,559 bytes and 19.65 s
with static literals and ordinary debug metadata omitted. Sharing string
release, cell-payload release, and union-copy dispatch reduces it further to
3,697,941 bytes, with 230,500 KiB peak process RSS. The latter sample took
20.21 s (11.57 checking, 3.42 lowering, 0.55 emission, 3.71 backend) while
other validation was running; use its output size, not the small wall-time
difference, to compare these batches. This is still a module benchmark,
not achievement of the full-build target.

Copy helpers retain distinct prepared/unprepared and move modes. Copies
that might construct fixed-size storage in the caller's frame remain
inline. Release helpers only dispatch ownership and reclaim existing
storage. The 24-caller union-array kernel is now 309,077 bytes, with a
400 KB regression budget (formerly 729,334 bytes after array-helper sharing).
Thirty focused release/ownership tests and twenty-five copy-helper tests
pass. The broader union/recursive/ownership group passed 109 cases and
exposed two fixed-array temporary lifetime failures; after the lifetime fix,
all thirteen record/result regressions pass, including those two failures.

Array element ownership is now consistent on the hosted side: literals,
copies, and prepared array results own their record roots as well as fields,
even when the pointer buffer is frame-backed. Replacing an element releases
the old value after materializing its replacement; raw exposure preserves
pinned old elements. Scope exit releases copied record roots, and temporary
fixed-array results release their elements after reads. The combined test
covers inheritance, fixed results, self-replacement, preserved snapshots,
repeated-scope reclamation, and raw pointers without assuming brand layout.
It also found a native omission: index replacement released pinned elements.
The corrected native lowering passes the same kernel on direct and C routes.

Artifacts: `phase0-performance/host-static-literals-t0`,
`host-cell-helpers-t0`, `shared-release-union-kernel.udewy`,
`static-literal-*-gates.log`, `record-replace-complete-gates.log`,
`pinned-replacement-native-gates.log`, `shared-release-gates.log`,
`shared-cell-copy-gates.log`, `shared-cell-ownership-gates.log`, and
`fixed-result-lifetime-gates.log`. The reusable native lowering driver is
recorded in `pinned-replacement/driver-path.txt`; it includes the pinned
replacement fix, but is not a new full native compiler or fixed point.
