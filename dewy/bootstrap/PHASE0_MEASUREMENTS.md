# Phase 0 performance campaign

The acceptance target remains a complete compiler executable build in under
60 seconds through **each** implementation. The module measurements below
are bounded development gates; they do not establish that full-build target.
See [ROADMAP.md](../ROADMAP.md#dedicated-performance-campaign).

## Reproduction and isolation

`tools/measure_compiler.py SOURCE --output NEW_DIRECTORY` measures the hosted
CLI, including its in-process µDewy backend. Add `--native-executable PATH`
and `--udewy-executable PATH` to measure the native pair. Each run uses a fresh
process and empty artifact directory. OS page caches are uncontrolled.
`--profile` adds hosted cProfile data; its elapsed times include profiling
overhead and must not be compared to unprofiled acceptance measurements.
JSON records retain source/revision identity, options, wall time, maximum
process RSS, generated-source sizes/hashes, and hosted phase timings. Maximum
process RSS is not the sum of simultaneously resident child processes.

`tools/check_compiler_parity.py --native-executable PATH --udewy-executable PATH
--output NEW_DIRECTORY` checks each existing end-to-end fixture independently.
Compilation and execution results are separate; expected exits and output are
checked before comparing implementations. `--cases FILE` also accepts negative
cases, and `--hosted-root PATH` pins a source snapshot while development
continues. A timeout, crash, or backend failure does not count as a successful
language rejection. Exact diagnostic wording is not part of parity.
The default inventory includes ten isolated rejection fixtures for names,
initialization, types, bounds, const mutation and stored contracts. Both
baseline compilers reject all ten at the language-checking boundary.

## Initial bounded baseline — 2026-09-14

Machine: Intel Core i7-6700, 3.40 GHz, Linux x86-64. Python 3.14.7, GCC
16.2.1, GNU assembler/linker 2.46.1. Source revision `18fadc66`, module
`dewy/bootstrap/parser/t0.dewy` (SHA-256
`b884a751e3e46eb4779d0f774651237eee985eacdf7630c08bc6532473a88847`).
Native compiler: the verified eighteenth pair, Dewy executable SHA-256
`5140aa2f2bfb5b2a09656d33c59db8f631c49d14e8b1c90ca7adaa99a3243ae8`.
Both invocations produce a direct x86-64 executable; the native compiler
itself was built through C. Default CLI options: hosted emission includes
location markers, native ordinary compilation does not.

| Implementation | Complete invocation | Checking | Lowering | Emission | Backend | Maximum process RSS | µDewy bytes |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Hosted baseline | 34.74 s | 15.51 s | 11.01 s | 2.59 s | 4.71 s | 274,828 KiB | 5,675,282 |
| Native baseline | 61.70 s | — | — | — | — | 941,620 KiB | 5,984,229 |
| Hosted representation query cache | 25.21 s | 15.11 s | 3.67 s | 0.87 s | 4.60 s | 275,424 KiB | 5,675,291 |

| Hosted lexer batch | 21.20 s | 10.53 s | 4.16 s | 0.92 s | 4.67 s | 273,148 KiB | 5,675,273 |

These are single samples, with other work on separate CPUs; use repeated
samples for close comparisons. The nine-byte output difference is entirely
the embedded benchmark directory names in three `$include_bytes` paths.
After normalizing those directory names, emitted text is identical.

The first batch caches representation queries by input identity during
lowering/emission, object layouts and union tags per lowerer, and resolved
source paths per emission. Checked type objects remain strongly referenced
until the scope ends. No query cache spans checker mutations, alias resolution,
brand registration, or compilations. Regression checks cover failed-scope
cleanup, mutable unions, identical uncached output, expected execution, and
array-sharing budgets on direct and C output routes.

The traversal batch caches class field metadata, preserves unchanged subtrees
during module renaming, and walks the prelude dependency graph once per
reachable declaration. Both compilers skip predicate-read traversal when the
invalidated-binding set is empty. Output again matches the original after
directory normalization. Prelude cache restoration, effect summaries, and
native short-circuit proof-path checks pass (22 focused tests).

The next hosted profile shifts attention to cold prelude checking, repeated
analysis traversals, and the µDewy tokenizer. Native phase profiling and
checked-prelude caching remain separate work. The initial full native
self-build baseline remains the approximately 25-minute generation recorded
in [PERFORMANCE.md](PERFORMANCE.md#completed-native-fixed-point-2026-09-14).

## Shared native record operations

The verified native compiler emitted 96.7 MB for its own source: 19.7 MB was
record copy helpers and 7.3 MB release helpers. Parent views repeatedly
expanded every descendant's concrete fields, including inline nested records
and union cells. Native lowering now shares family dispatch separately from
exact field operations. Arena-free copies stay in their caller's frame.

The twelve-level `native_record_family_helpers.dewy` kernel drops from
281,377 to 124,977 bytes of µDewy (56% smaller), with checking/lowering/emission
through the dedicated direct lowering driver falling from 6.27 to 4.38 seconds.
Both versions execute correctly through direct and C backends. Its committed
160 KB output budget catches reintroducing the expansion. Another new kernel
checks descendant copies through nested records, arrays and optional cells;
128 repeated scopes retain zero arena bytes. Thirty-nine existing record,
brand and reclamation cases also pass on both output routes. These are kernel
results, not yet a measurement of the full compiler's new generated size.

## Lexer copying and next integration seed

Sampling the full hosted build exposed a source suffix copy for every token
class probe. Sharing that suffix across probes, selecting longest matches in
one pass, and using offsets for inner delimiter tests reduces tokenization of
`bootstrap/backend/udewy/lower.dewy` from 44.83 to 3.83 seconds. Both versions
produce exactly the same 70,656 token kinds, texts, spans and indices (combined
SHA-256 `ce923f4d2e8bd993c82d280c10a68695ebe21c8ef8a728cc5dc2834e28fdaedf`).
The µDewy tokenizer also groups ordinary symbol probes by initial character,
retaining longest-match order and contextual token handling. Forty-nine lexer,
literal-boundary and µDewy precedence/type tests pass. These changes preserve
µDewy's conditional-only short-circuit rule.

A full hosted C build of revision `8116d279` successfully produced the next
native test compiler: 113.7 MB of µDewy and 215.3 MB of C. Its initial sampling
profiler substantially perturbed checking and interrupted the measurement
parent; the compiler child completed successfully. This is an integration
artifact, **not a clean full-build timing**. Recorded phase times include
198.5 seconds checking, 103.2 lowering, 17.4 emission, and 428.6 backend; maximum
process RSS was 6,735,356 KiB. The build bypassed ccache and used GCC with
eight LTO jobs.

That hosted-built seed compiles the t0 module in 71.71 seconds, producing
4,583,067 bytes of µDewy (23% less than the verified native baseline), with
maximum process RSS of 3,571,432 KiB. The seed's storage behavior differs from
the native-built baseline, so this does not establish a runtime improvement
for the helper batch: generation provenance must accompany native timings.
It has not yet passed a new native fixed-point verification. The sub-minute
full-build target remains open.

## Hosted record-family helpers

The hosted backend now also selects shared concrete-field helpers for arena
copies and releases. Non-moving result writes reuse ordinary arena copies
when their fields need no caller-prepared fixed-array storage; move/adopt and
prepared-array cases retain their separate rules. The guarded twelve-level
inheritance fixture shrinks from 2,544,010 to 607,930 bytes (76% smaller), with
both outputs returning the expected result through direct and C backends.
The new hosted output budget is 700 KB, including reachable runtime code.
Another execution case covers fixed arrays nested in both base and descendant
fields, so sharing cannot silently discard prepared destination storage.
Sixty-six focused ownership, array-sharing, release and default-argument tests
pass alongside those two new cases.

The inheritance fixture now also guards its variable-length indexed reads
and writes, allowing the complete hosted checker to validate it. Its native
lowering-driver output is 146,253 bytes, still below the existing 160 KB gate,
and executes correctly on both routes. The earlier 124,977-byte native kernel
measurement predates those guards; compare like fixture revisions.

## Isolated parity repair: lenient set pop

The accepted-program inventory exposed a native crash in `sets.dewy`.
`pop(key default=none)` returned bare payloads on both branches instead of
the optional cell its checked result type requires; discarding a missing
result then dereferenced zero during cleanup. Native lowering now packs
both alternatives and releases an unused packed default with its result
type. The isolated fixture crashes through both old output backends and
returns 42 through both updated backends. The hosted version also returns
42. Cases cover present/absent/discarded integer and string results, eager
defaults, and zero retained arena growth over 64 repeated scopes. A fresh
full-native corpus run remains an integration gate.
