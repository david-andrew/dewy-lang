# Native compiler performance and open storage design

Copy-on-write is a provisional implementation strategy, approved for making
native bootstrapping practical. It preserves value independence while sharing
aggregate backing storage until mutation. It is **not** a settled commitment
to unpredictable first-write latency in the language's long-term cost model.

Open design question: how can Dewy's types, facts, ownership and lifetime
information make copying and reclamation predictable, ideally zero-cost?
Candidates include statically established unique ownership, moves, bounded
borrows, immutable sharing, and storage partitioned by lifetime. Evaluate
nested updates and arrays with large backing buffers explicitly: an O(1)
snapshot can otherwise conceal an O(n) first write. Do not add source-level
ownership features without language-design review.

The optimized C route is a bootstrap accelerator. Reasonably performant
Dewy -> µDewy -> native machine code builds without the C backend remain an
explicit goal. General aggregate representation and analysis improvements
must benefit both execution routes. Keep both hosted and bootstrap lowering
implementations consistent, including place arguments and dynamic brands.

Performance gates precede expensive bootstrap generation checks. Use bounded
representative kernels for read-only graph access, context construction,
branch snapshots, nested mutations and repeated module analysis. Account for
copied bytes, allocations and peak live storage; test scaling and reclamation,
not just elapsed time. A full self-build is a final integration check, not the
inner development loop.
