How to compile (for linux) completely standalone:
- see: https://lists.sr.ht/~mpu/qbe/%3Ca8afa424-5fcc-f241-d630-dd6fbac0ded2%40gmail.com%3E
- basically have a short x86_64 assembly that provides the syscall interface
- then use syscalls from qbe
- also define _start as the entry point in qbe
- then link the assembly and qbe output together


qbe metal.qbe > metal.s && as -o metal.o metal.s && as -o syscalls.o syscalls.x86_64 && ld -o app syscalls.o metal.o && ./app
