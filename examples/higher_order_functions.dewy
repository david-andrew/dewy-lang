% Higher order functions

% currently there is a parser bug where these are ambiguous and require more general QAST support

f = () => () => () => 42

% what happens here? is the result `42` or `() => () => 42`? probably the latter
printl(f)   % () => () => 42
printl(f()) % () => () => 42
printl(f()()) % () => 42
printl(f()()()) % 42
% printl(f()()()()) % error

% TBD if this would work
printl((f))   % () => () => 42
printl((f)()) % () => 42
printl((f)()()) % 42



g = (x) => (y) => (z) => x + y + z
printl(g(1)) % (y) => (z) => x + y + z | with captured x=1
printl(g(1)(2)) % (z) => x + y + z | with captured x=1, y=2
printl(g(1)(2)(3)) % 6
