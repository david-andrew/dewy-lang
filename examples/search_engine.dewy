Basically create a minimal functional search engine from scratch
this video someone makes a pretty janky one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXBIr719tZg
My version would probably start as the simplest possible engine with the following features:
- tf-idf for relevance
- micro/edge LLM analysis for identifying how sloppy content is. less slop means higher weight
- later can add a lot of the high usage support like load balancing, reverse proxy, etc.
