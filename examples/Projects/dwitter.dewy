basically remake dwitter using dewy from end to end: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiX135GIdL8
so user's can write dewy code in the browser that gets compiled and run on and generates some output
perhaps convenient functions available for drawing (perhaps register or array-based or shader-esque interface), emitting sound, etc.
I think it should be 1kb allowed rather than 140 characters. Perhaps even base the size directly on the AST rather than raw number of characters so that user's don't have to squish things down to fit (ideally whitespace and variable name lengths are free)

Probably also this would be a great example to put in the docs under Hello Many Worlds
