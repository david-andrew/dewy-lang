# Basic Data Types

## Numeric

Numeric data is what it sounds like, values that represent a number

### Numbers

Numbers are the base case for numerical values, with each subsequent type being a more specific / restricted version of the number class.

```dewy
my_number = 10
```

### Integers

Integers are numbers that do not contain any decimal component. By default, integers can be arbitrarily large, but fixed width integers are also possible

```dewy
my_int = -12 as int
my_int32 = 42 as int32

my_uint = 15 as uint
my_uint64 = 2001 as uint64
```

### Custom Ranged Integers

You can create integer types with a custom range by specifying the range as part of the type annotation

```dewy
my_custom_number:int<range=[42..)> = 42
```

TBD for behavior when value goes out of bounds. Perhaps result will be undefined, or there can be a type setting for wrap around

### Fixed Point

Fixed point will be stored as two integers, `digits` and `shift` where the value is `digits * 10^shift`

TBD on the syntax for declaring a fixed point number. likely to be a function call e.g.

```dewy
my_fixed_point = fixed_point(3141592 -6)
```

### Rational

Rational numbers are stored as two integers, the `numerator` and the `denominator`, where the value is `numerator / denominator`

TBD on the syntax for declaring a rational number. likely to be a function call e.g.

```dewy
my_rational = rational(22 7) %rational approximation of pi
```

### Real

Real numbers are positive and negative numbers that can have a decimal component to them. The default real will be stored as a `float64` i.e. a 64-bit floating point number, but other widths (and potentially arbitrary precision) are possible

```dewy
my_real = 3.1415
my_real32 = 54.54 as real32
my_real64 = 233.511534 as real64
```

### Boolean

Standard true/false type

```dewy
my_bool = true
```

### Complex

complex numbers

```dewy
my_complex0 = 2^/2 + 2i^/2
my_complex1 = complex(2^/2 2^/2)
my_complex2 = complex(1 45°)
my_complex3 = 1 ∠ 45°
```

### Quaternions

Quaternions

```dewy
q = 1 + 2i + 3j + 4k
Q = 1 + 2I + 3J + 4K   % can use lower or uppercase
```
