# Introduction

Welcome to the Dewy Programming Language Book. This book covers all aspects of the language, including syntax, style, the standard library, examples, etc.

> Please note that this book and the language are still VERY work in progress. The book is still missing many chapters, and the current language implementation is very incomplete.

## What is Dewy

The Dewy Programming Language is a simple yet powerful general purpose language designed with engineering applications in mind. Think the functionality and ease of use of matlab or python combined with the speed of a compiled language like C or Rust

## Who is Dewy for

Dewy is for everyone! Dewy is designed to be easy to learn and use, while still being powerful enough to be used for real world applications. Dewy is designed to be a general purpose language, and can be used for anything from simple scripting to complex engineering applications.

## Features

Dewy has many unique and uncommon features allowing it to be powerful and easy to use. Some key features include:

- **Functional and Imperative** - Dewy is an imperative language with strong support for functional programming. This allows for a very flexible programming style, where you can use the best tool for the job.
- **Expression based syntax** - Dewy uses an expression based syntax, meaning that everything is an expression. This allows for a very simple yet powerful syntax, where common language features often are just a free consequence of the syntax
- **Garbage-collector-free memory management** - Dewy uses a unique memory management system, allowing for fast and efficient memory management without the need for a garbage collector.
- **Strong type system** - Dewy has a powerful static type system with inference, reminiscent of those in Typescript and Julia.
- **Built in unit system** - Dewy has a built in unit system, allowing you to easily work with units and convert between them. This is especially useful for engineering applications.
- **Strong math support** - Dewy has strong support many math features, including complex numbers, quaternions, vectors, matrices, and more. This is especially useful for engineering applications.
