# PDF Viewer + Editor
basically build from the ground up PDF rendering, form filling (including XFA forms), signing (by overalying an image the user moves to the right location), adding text/elements, deleting existing text/elements, digital signing (with appropriate security keys), etc. And ability to save as a new pdf

I want this to be my one-stop-shop replacement for anything to do with PDFs, as they have historically been such a pain in the butt to deal with

should work on any operating system (that Dewy compiles to)

Doesn't need to be a full document editor like MS word or libreoffice, just have the functionality above I listed

Also potentially make a new competing document format that works better (or look at existing competing standards). Whatever's best, make first class support for
