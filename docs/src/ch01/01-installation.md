# Installation

Currently, only the python interpreter backend is available. To install it, you must have **python 3.11** or later installed. Then to install:
1. Clone the repo
    ```bash
    $ git clone git@github.com:david-andrew/dewy-lang.git
    ```
2. Run the install script
    ```bash
    $ cd dewy-lang
    $ python install.py
    ```
3. Log out and back in

## Verify Install

When you do have the language properly installed, you should be able to verify that it works like so:

```bash
$ dewy -v
Dewy 0.0.0
```
